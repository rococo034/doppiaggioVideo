WEBVTT
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
damn animations how many times there
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we found ourselves browsing sites
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
really very very ugly internet either
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
at least very much is p this
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
it happens because very often the
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
developers don&#39;t give it right
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
importance to animations considering that
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the site only has to provide the
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
information but do not take into account one
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
very important thing called user
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
experience in fact a site with
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
animations that attention with animation
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I don&#39;t mean things that fly randomly
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I mean a response for each action that
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
the user performs within our
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
site
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
trivially when hovering over it
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
a key the key must fulfill
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
an action change color yes but maybe
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
even get bigger or move around
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
slightly to make the navigator understand
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
which clicking on that button will go to
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
actually perform an action these
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
animations are very often done with
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
jquery and can be a lot too
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
very complex
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
however, there is a much simpler method
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and also faster called anime it css
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
in this video I explain it in
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
detail let&#39;s not dwell too much
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
then let&#39;s move on to practice by way of
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
get started right away let&#39;s google it
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
trivially we type anime point css a
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
this point we will be offered a few
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
search results what
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
we care and animated css that is
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
reachable via the anime address
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
it punto style
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
we click and until we realize
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
very simple interface is
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
it pretty much works that way
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
here we practically have the effect
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
final that we will get by selecting a
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
obviously css effect
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
who is practically present in the part
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
in the first section po on the right
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
so if we hover here and
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
we go down we see this list
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
increases more and more and trying trivially
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
to click on fade on the left
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
let&#39;s actually see what happens
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
fading dow faith in let fading bright
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
knapp wedding rings and so flip and hynix flipout
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
this is practically all
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
effects therefore all the donations that
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
we can do with anime and css then
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
for example, we can ensure that al
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
loading our page
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
therefore written in this case aliment
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
css which is what to this class but
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
obviously we can give this class a
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
whatever else we can say
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I don&#39;t know when the page loads
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I shop for pulse and just like
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
this
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:49.000
or another effect I don&#39;t know the wall
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
or the bouncing or better still the
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
fade in then that it appears to fai da hopa
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
the fade out disappears or or
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
or other effects such as in routes
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:07.000
hidrotec in or their utilities ott per
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:10.000
disappear slidin or slide out
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
in short, they are all the small effects that
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
we can go put to loading
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
of the page for example me on my blog
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and lasting rinaldi punto with the
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
practically this effect on entry
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
which is very banal let&#39;s see if we see that
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
this effect is practically in the logo
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
here that present is called watles
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
wrong ulta da is very nice because it does
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
yes come on which best should be
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
this
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
exact very pretty because anyway from
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
a minimum of movement to the page e
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
it still makes our site animated
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
how to implement this anime&#39;s
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
css go and assign it to some
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
very simple elements
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
we go down here anyway
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
the installation through various typologies
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
including terminals also but not there
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
interest
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
trivially if we copied this
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
code string and then inside
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
of the two atc copy the andassimo paste
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
in another tab we will obviously have
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
this perfect code means that the
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
link works what we do
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
we close then copy this line of
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
code and come and go come man
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
mano
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and of course we are going to create a
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.000
html document then html and not
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
we have to do other than as it comes to us
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
said here go to insert this line
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
of code then let&#39;s copy
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
everything actually all the link and go
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
paste inside and let&#39;s go
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000
inside then after the title
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000
maybe we paste here we can pull up
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:56.000
OK perfect
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:58.000
we save perfect document and of course
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
now we have to decide which element
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
give these animations now inside
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
of body I will create a test item
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:12.000
so i dont know a gdp a tough paragraph
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:17.000
net this the element they want
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
animate save and we must do only
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
this operation dominate as it comes to us
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
said when for example base and insert
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
these two classes
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
then the first that will always be from
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
recall that souls double iter
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
animated underscore which is pretty much
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
the class that will invoke the animation
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
initial then initialize
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
the animation and then the other animated
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
double underscore is followed by the
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
from the effect in this case it is this one
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that I want to go
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
let&#39;s try for example to put that of
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000
try animating double underscores
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000
bounce then space anime iter 12
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
bounce let&#39;s save and see what
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
happens inside of our file
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
then we bring the file in html lo
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
we open with a browser and when opening or
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
when the page is re-loaded
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
we should have this animation then
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
at the Bauhaus
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
obviously me at the moment or the
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
top left top moment
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
because by default it starts at the top a
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
left but I could go on to say no
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I know obviously with a style I don&#39;t know
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
margin top 400 to be a little more
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
bottom and align the text in the center
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
then text align center
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
css base by reloading we have at least one
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
element a moment cuter
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
obviously we can go customize it
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:49.000
how we want so I don&#39;t know 50 pixels
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:55.000
color I&#39;m going to put a 4 done 4 that
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:57.000
a gray and a family arial in font
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
this case we have at least one title a
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
perfect cutest moment
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
of course we can in this case
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
always through anime punto style
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
change the effect is obviously meters
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
that not just bounce where we have to do
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
we have to copy in the class and
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000
stick it practically in place of bonus
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
hence animated double underscore or
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
better dubbing to listen to bounce in
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
perfect copying it from which it takes us
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
directly also double minds
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000
underscore where refilling some tea
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
the effect you see that the exchange effect
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
we could also go to integrate the
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
our animated css css with gq yesterday
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000
going to specify I&#39;m not going to ago
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000
effects as we see the rollout where
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
four lines roll out then ensure that
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
to load the page of ours
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000
text appears this way is eg
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
after 5 seconds automatically go away e
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
disappear then as we do we must
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
go integrate jquery but we see it a
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
other video so to go to
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000
focus on this integration that
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.000
it is not complex but still needs to
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000
a few minutes of explanation is
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
especially a targeted jquery focus
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
so for now I&#39;ll leave you to the fun
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
with cssn foods obviously see you
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
to the next video
